## Your Tasks

Python’s list method `sort` includes the keyword argument `reverse`, whose default value is `False`. The programmer can override this value to sort a list in descending order. Modify the `selectionSort` function (in the file **sort.py**) discussed in this chapter so that it allows the programmer to supply this additional argument to redirect the sort. (LO: 13.4)
