## Your Tasks

In many card games, cards are either face up or face down. Add a new instance variable named `faceup` to the `Card` class (in the file **cards.py**) to track this attribute of a card. Its default value is ` False`. Then add a `turn` method to turn the card over. This method resets the `faceup` variable to its logical negation. (LO: 10.1, 10.2)

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Add `faceup` instance variable to the `Card` class.

**Task 2**: Add `turn` method to `Card` class.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
A new deck, cards face down:
Ace of Spades False
2 of Spades False
3 of Spades False
...

...
Jack of Spades False
Queen of Spades False
King of Spades False
Ace of Diamonds False
2 of Diamonds False
3 of Diamonds False
...
