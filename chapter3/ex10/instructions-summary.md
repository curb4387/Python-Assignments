## Your Tasks

The credit plan at TidBit Computer Store specifies a 10% down payment and an annual interest rate of 12%. Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase price.

Write a program in the file **tidbit.py** that takes the purchase price as input. The program should display a table, with appropriate headers, of a payment schedule for the lifetime of the loan. Each row of the table should contain the following items:

- the month number (beginning with 1)
- the current total balance owed
- the interest owed for that month
- the amount of principal owed for that month
- the payment for that month
- the balance remaining after payment

The amount of interest for a month is equal to balance \* rate / 12. The amount of principal for a month is equal to the monthly payment minus the interest owed. (LO: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
