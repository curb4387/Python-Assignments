EICC Fall 2024 Python: Coding Assignments

This repo has all coding exercises that I completed for my Fall 2024 class: Python. It also includes chapters 10-12 which we did not go over. Throughout the rest of the year, I will reorganize the subdirectories, and complete the coding exercises for chapters 10-12.

To review what I have learned, including the textbook and other programming exercises, refer to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qVaKEeml9PDY434xLx8GJRl7gF6LcFlh?usp=drive_link
