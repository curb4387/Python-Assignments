## Instructions

Follow the steps outlined below to successfully complete the tasks for this assignment. The tasks represent the goals and objectives for this lab and can be found in the Your Task section located below the Instructions.

1. Locate and complete Tasks 1 and 2 in the "Your Task" section. When finished, continue with Step 2.
2. Complete Task 3 by copying and pasting the following code in the workspace:

```python
#This is the code editor
def example():
    print("This is a simple activity.")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example()
```

3. Select “RUN EXAMPLE.PY” to see what happens. You should see the output displayed in the Terminal: _This is a simple activity._ If your lab contains multiple files, use the dropdown arrow to select the specific file you would like to run.
4. Check Task 3 by selecting the greyed-out box to the left of the task.
5. To see your current score, select “Calculate Grade.” This will run all the tasks in the assignment and display your score.
6. If all tasks are completed and you are satisfied with your score, select “Submit” to let your instructor know that you have finished the assignment.
7. If you make any additional changes, your grade will be recalculated during submission.

> IMPORTANT: If you continue to have questions about using the code editor, review the videos in the Course Orientation folder or talk to your instructor before completing your first graded assignment


## Your Tasks

Sometimes it takes a little while for tasks to complete. Be patient.

**Task 1**: This is a sample task. Click the grey icon next to "Task 2" to see what a task failure looks like. A task failure means the goals and the requirements for the task have NOT been met and you should fix your code and try again.

**Task 2**: This is an example task. Each task contains "checks" which are run against your code to check that the goals and the requirements for the task have been met.

**Task 3**: Cut and paste the code into the editor and run. Observe the output before moving on.


## How to Use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Preview

Some of the lab assignments will require you to create GUI-based programs. In order to view the output, you will need to open and connect to the VNC viewer.

Practice opening the viewer:

Select the "Open GUI" <svg alt-text='View GUI Icon' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20px" fill="#5f6368"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M18.25 7.6l-5.5-3.18c-.46-.27-1.04-.27-1.5 0L5.75 7.6c-.46.27-.75.76-.75 1.3v6.35c0 .54.29 1.03.75 1.3l5.5 3.18c.46.27 1.04.27 1.5 0l5.5-3.18c.46-.27.75-.76.75-1.3V8.9c0-.54-.29-1.03-.75-1.3zM7 14.96v-4.62l4 2.32v4.61l-4-2.31zm5-4.03L8 8.61l4-2.31 4 2.31-4 2.32zm1 6.34v-4.61l4-2.32v4.62l-4 2.31zM7 2H3.5C2.67 2 2 2.67 2 3.5V7h2V4h3V2zm10 0h3.5c.83 0 1.5.67 1.5 1.5V7h-2V4h-3V2zM7 22H3.5c-.83 0-1.5-.67-1.5-1.5V17h2v3h3v2zm10 0h3.5c.83 0 1.5-.67 1.5-1.5V17h-2v3h-3v2z"/></svg> option from the sidebar. This will open a new tab connecting to the VNC Viewer.

Once open, select "connect".
If prompted enter the password: **vscode**

This will open a “Simple Browser” tab displaying the VNC Viewer.

X out of the “Simple Browser” to continue with your activity.

Updates to your program’s GUI will not be reflected while a GUI application is running. To view updates to your program ensure you have terminated the GUI application by clicking the `x` on the GUI applications window.
