## Your Tasks

Write a program (in the file **average.py**) that computes and prints the average of the numbers in a text file. You should make use of two higher-order functions to simplify the design. (LO: 7.2)

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the **average.py** program so that it computes and prints the average of the numbers in a text file

An example of the program is shown below:

```txt
22 81 137
```

```txt
Enter the input file name: numbers.txt
The average is 80.0
```
