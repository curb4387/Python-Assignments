## Your Tasks

Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (_Case Study 3-2_) in a function named `newton`. This function expects the input number as an argument and returns the estimate of its square root. The script in the file named **newton.py** should also include a `main` function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses the enter/return key. (LO: 6.2)

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Define the `newton` function.

**Task 2**: The program also includes a `main` function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until the enter/return key is pressed.

An example of the program is shown below:

```txt
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 2
The program's estimate is 1.4142135623746899
Python's estimate is      1.4142135623730951
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 4
The program's estimate is 2.0000000929222947
Python's estimate is      2.0
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 9
The program's estimate is 3.000000001396984
Python's estimate is      3.0
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit:
