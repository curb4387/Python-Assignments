## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

The tax calculator program of the case study outputs a floating-point number that might show more than two digits of precision.

**Task 1**: Use the round function to modify the program in the file **taxform.py** to display at most two digits of precision in the output number. (LO: 2.4)
