## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.

**Task 1**: Write a program in **cube.py** that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cube’s surface area as output. (LO: 2.4)
