## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

Light travels at 3 \* 10‚Å∏ meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam travels in one year.

**Task 1**: Write a program in the file **lightyear.py** that expects a number of years as input and calculates and displays the value of the distance traveled in meters. (LO: 2.4)
