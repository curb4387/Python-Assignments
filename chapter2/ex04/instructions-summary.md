## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write a program in the file **sphere.py** that takes the radius of a sphere (a floating-point number) as input and then outputs the sphereâ€™s diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume. (LO: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5)
