## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula _KE = (1/2) mv²_, where _m_ is the object’s mass and _v_ is its velocity.

**Task 1**: Modify the program you created in <!-- TK:  -->Programming Exercise 5 so that it prints the object’s kinetic energy as well as its momentum. (LO: 2.3, 2.4)
