## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity.

**Task 1**: Write a program in the file **momentum.py** that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as inputs and then outputs its momentum. (LO: 2.3, 2.4)
