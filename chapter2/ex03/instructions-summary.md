## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

Five Star Retro Video rents DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy vinyl records. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night.

**Task 1**: Write a program in the file **fivestar.py** that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost. (LO: 2.3, 2.4)
